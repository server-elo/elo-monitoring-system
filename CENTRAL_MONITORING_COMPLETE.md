# 🌐 Central Multi-PC Monitoring System Complete!

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

Your monitoring system now has **both individual PC monitoring AND central aggregation** to see all PCs from anywhere!

### 🎯 **Two-Tier Architecture**
1. **Individual PC Monitoring** (Port 3002)
   - Each PC runs its own monitoring service
   - Shows detailed metrics for that specific PC
   - Reports data to central service

2. **Central Aggregation Service** (Port 3001)
   - Discovers and tracks all PCs automatically
   - Shows unified view of all machines
   - Beautiful multi-PC dashboard

## 🚀 How to Use

### **Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)**
```bash
# Start complete monitoring system
./central-monitoring-manager.sh full-start

# Check status
./central-monitoring-manager.sh full-status

# Stop everything
./central-monitoring-manager.sh full-stop
```

### **Option 2: Manual Control**
```bash
# Start central service only
./central-monitoring-manager.sh start

# Start individual PC monitoring
./monitoring-manager.sh start

# Check individual services
./central-monitoring-manager.sh status
./monitoring-manager.sh status
```

## 📊 Dashboard Access

| Dashboard | URL | What You See |
|-----------|-----|--------------|
| **🌐 Central Multi-PC** | http://localhost:3001 | **ALL PCs** in one view |
| **💻 Individual PC** | http://localhost:3002 | **This PC only** detailed view |

## 🎯 What Each Dashboard Shows

### **Central Dashboard (Port 3001)**
- **📊 Aggregated Stats**: Total PCs, active PCs, total alerts
- **🖥️ PC Grid**: Each PC as a card with its metrics
- **🚨 Cross-PC Alerts**: All alerts from all PCs
- **⏰ Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh every 10 seconds
- **🎨 Beautiful Design**: Glass morphism with gradients

**Perfect for:** Seeing all your development machines at once

### **Individual PC Dashboard (Port 3002)**
- **💻 Current PC Info**: This PC's hostname, user, platform
- **📈 Detailed Metrics**: Response times, error rates, health checks
- **🚨 PC-Specific Alerts**: Only alerts from this machine
- **⏰ Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh every 5 seconds

**Perfect for:** Deep dive into this specific PC's health

## 🔄 How PC Discovery Works

### **Automatic Discovery**
1. Central service scans ports 3002, 3003, 3004, 3005
2. Finds any running PC monitoring services
3. Automatically adds them to the central dashboard
4. Updates every 10 seconds

### **PC Registration**
1. Each PC reports its metrics to central service
2. Central service tracks: `username@hostname`
3. Shows real-time status for each PC
4. Removes PCs that haven't reported in 5 minutes

## 🖥️ Multi-PC Setup

### **For Your Second User/PC**
1. **Copy the project** to the second machine
2. **Start monitoring** with different port:
   ```bash
   MONITORING_PORT=3003 ./monitoring-manager.sh start
   ```
3. **Central service automatically discovers** the new PC
4. **See both PCs** in central dashboard at http://localhost:3001
