- Security middleware templates
- Deployment configuration files
- Testing framework setup

**Impact**: Professional codebase structure from start

#### **6. `/prp-deep-scan`**

We get:
> "Plan Comprehensively → Build Once → Deploy to Production"

### **When to Use PRP**

**Always use PRP for:**
- ✅ Any feature requiring 3+ files
- ✅ Features with security implications  
- ✅ Features needing remote connectivity
- ✅ Features requiring scalability
- ✅ Production-critical functionality

**PRP is optional for:**
- Simple UI changes
- Single-file modifications  
- Proof-of-concept development
