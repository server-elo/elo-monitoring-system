# Smart PRP: Feature-Based Vertical Slice Architecture

## Meta Information
- **PRP ID**: architecture-feature-vertical-slices-002
- **Created**: 2025-01-20T17:30:00Z
- **Complexity Score**: 8/10
- **Estimated Implementation Time**: 12 hours
- **Dependencies**: [foundation-nextjs15-react19-typescript-001]

## 🎯 Feature Specification
### Core Requirement
Implement a feature-based vertical slice architecture that enables independent, scalable development of learning platform features while maintaining strict TypeScript safety, testability, and zero technical debt.

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Functional: Each feature module is completely self-contained with 0 external dependencies
- [ ] Performance: Feature loading time under 100ms with code splitting
- [ ] UX: Seamless navigation between features with consistent patterns
- [ ] Maintainability: New features can be added without touching existing code
- [ ] Quality: 95%+ test coverage per feature with isolated test environments

## 🔍 Codebase Intelligence
### Pattern Analysis
```markdown
Current foundation analysis:
- Directory: src/features/ exists with placeholders for main features
- Pattern: Vertical slice architecture preferred over layered architecture
- Integration: Next.js 15 App Router supports feature-based organization
- Benefits: Independent deployment, team autonomy, reduced coupling
```

### Architecture Alignment
- **Follows Pattern**: Domain-Driven Design with bounded contexts
- **Extends Component**: Next.js App Router file-system routing
- **Integration Points**: Shared UI components, authentication, database, real-time events

## 🧠 Implementation Strategy
### Approach Rationale
Feature-based vertical slices chosen over traditional layered architecture because:
1. **Team Autonomy**: Each feature team can work independently
2. **Deployment Independence**: Features can be deployed and rolled back separately
3. **Bounded Context**: Clear ownership and responsibility boundaries
4. **Technology Flexibility**: Features can use different approaches where needed
5. **Reduced Coupling**: Minimal dependencies between features

### Risk Mitigation
- **High Risk**: Feature sprawl and inconsistency → Shared design system and architectural guidelines
- **Medium Risk**: Cross-feature communication complexity → Event-driven architecture with clear APIs
- **Low Risk**: Code duplication → Shared utilities with clear boundaries

### Rollback Plan
1. Maintain modular structure allowing easy feature removal
2. Feature flags for progressive rollout and quick rollback
3. Database migrations with rollback scripts per feature
4. Component registry for easy replacement of feature components

## 📋 Execution Blueprint

### Phase 1: Core Architecture Setup
- [ ] Create feature slice template with all required directories and files
- [ ] Implement shared type definitions for cross-feature communication
- [ ] Set up feature registry system for dynamic loading and discovery

- [ ] Establish dependency injection container for shared services

### Phase 2: Feature Slice Implementation
- [ ] Implement Authentication feature slice with complete vertical stack
- [ ] Create Learning Engine feature slice with lesson management
- [ ] Build Collaboration feature slice with real-time capabilities

- [ ] Construct AI Tutor feature slice with LLM integration
- [ ] Build Gamification feature slice with achievement system

### Phase 3: Integration & Communication
- [ ] Implement event bus for inter-feature communication
- [ ] Create shared state management patterns with Zustand
- [ ] Set up API gateway patterns for external service calls
- [ ] Establish monitoring and observability per feature
- [ ] Create feature-specific error boundaries and fallbacks

### Phase 4: Developer Experience
- [ ] Create feature generation CLI tool for scaffolding new features
- [ ] Implement hot module replacement for feature development
- [ ] Set up feature-specific test environments and databases
- [ ] Create documentation generator for feature APIs
- [ ] Establish code quality gates per feature

## 🚀 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Feature Slice Template
```typescript
// Template structure for each feature

```

### Step 2: Feature Registry System
```typescript
// lib/features/registry.ts
export interface FeatureConfig {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  dependencies: string[];
  routes: string[];
  permissions: string[];
  loadPriority: number;
}

export class FeatureRegistry {
  private features = new Map<string, FeatureConfig>();
  
  register(config: FeatureConfig): void {
    this.validateDependencies(config);
    this.features.set(config.name, config);
  }
  
  load(featureName: string): Promise<FeatureModule> {
    // Dynamic import with error handling
  }
  
  getLoadOrder(): string[] {
    // Topological sort based on dependencies
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Inter-Feature Communication
```typescript
// lib/events/eventBus.ts
export interface FeatureEvent {
  type: string;
  payload: unknown;
  source: string;
  timestamp: number;
}

export class EventBus {
  private listeners = new Map<string, Set<EventListener>>();
  
  emit<T>(event: FeatureEvent): void {
    // Type-safe event emission with validation
  }
  
  subscribe<T>(eventType: string, listener: EventListener<T>): () => void {
    // Type-safe subscription with automatic cleanup
  }
}
```

### Step 4: Shared Types and Contracts
```typescript
// types/shared/index.ts
export interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  role: UserRole;
  preferences: UserPreferences;
}

export interface FeatureAPI {
  name: string;
  version: string;
  endpoints: APIEndpoint[];
  events: EventDefinition[];
}

// Strict contracts between features
export interface CrossFeatureContract {
  provider: string;
  consumer: string;
  interface: string;
  version: string;
}
```

### Step 5: Feature-Specific Error Boundaries
```typescript
// components/errors/FeatureErrorBoundary.tsx
interface FeatureErrorBoundaryProps {
  featureName: string;
  fallback?: React.ComponentType<{error: Error}>;
  onError?: (error: Error, errorInfo: ErrorInfo) => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

export function FeatureErrorBoundary({
  featureName,
  fallback: Fallback,
  onError,
  children
}: FeatureErrorBoundaryProps): React.ReactElement {
  // Feature-isolated error handling with reporting
}
```
