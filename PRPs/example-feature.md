# PRP: Example Feature Implementation

## Meta Information
- **PRP ID**: example-001
- **Created**: 2024-01-01T00:00:00
- **Complexity Score**: 5/10
- **Estimated Implementation Time**: 4 hours

## 🎯 Feature Specification
### Core Requirement
Implement a user authentication system with JWT tokens

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Functional: Users can login/logout successfully
- [ ] Performance: Authentication completes in <200ms
- [ ] UX: Smooth login flow with proper error handling

## 🔍 Codebase Intelligence
### Pattern Analysis
```markdown
Similar patterns found in codebase:
- Authentication middleware in middleware/auth.js
- JWT utilities in utils/jwt.js
- User models in models/User.js
```

## 🧠 Implementation Strategy
### Approach Rationale
Following existing authentication patterns for consistency

### Risk Mitigation
- **High Risk**: Security vulnerabilities → Security review and testing
- **Medium Risk**: Performance impact → Benchmarking and optimization

## 📋 Execution Blueprint
### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Set up JWT configuration
- [ ] Create authentication middleware

### Phase 2: Core Implementation
- [ ] Implement login/logout endpoints
- [ ] Add token validation

### Phase 3: Integration & Testing
- [ ] Write comprehensive tests
- [ ] Security testing
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

## 🔬 Validation Matrix
### Automated Tests
```bash
npm test -- auth
npm run test:security
npm run test:performance
```

### Manual Verification
- [ ] Login with valid credentials → Success
- [ ] Login with invalid credentials → Proper error
- [ ] Access protected route → Token validation works

## 🎯 Confidence Score: 8/10
**Reasoning**: Well-established patterns, clear requirements, comprehensive testing
