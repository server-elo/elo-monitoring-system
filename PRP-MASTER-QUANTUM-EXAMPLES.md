    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, 'Insufficient balance');

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract LiquidityPool {
    mapping(address => uint256) public liquidity;
    uint256 public totalSupply;
    uint256 public constant FEE = 30; // 0.3%
    
    function addLiquidity(uint256 amount) external {
        liquidity[msg.sender] += amount;
        totalSupply += amount;
    }
    
    function swap(uint256 amountIn) external returns (uint256 amountOut) {
        uint256 fee = (amountIn * FEE) / 10000;
        amountOut = amountIn - fee;
        // Vulnerable: No slippage protection
        return amountOut;
    }
}

```bash
# 30-day threat analysis
npm run prp-master:predict -- 30 "
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract NFTMarketplace {
    struct Listing {
        address seller;
        uint256 price;
        bool active;
    }
    
    mapping(uint256 => Listing) public listings;
    
    function buy(uint256 tokenId) external payable {
        Listing storage listing = listings[tokenId];
        require(listing.active, 'Not for sale');
        require(msg.value >= listing.price, 'Insufficient payment');
        
        // Vulnerable: Reentrancy attack possible
        payable(listing.seller).transfer(msg.value);
