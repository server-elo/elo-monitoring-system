# Feature Branch Development Workflow

## 🎯 Overview

This document outlines our systematic feature-branch development strategy to avoid cycles of fixing the same issues repeatedly and provide better isolation for development.

## 🌳 Branch Structure

### Main Branches
- **`main`** - Production-ready code, only merge when features work together
- **`develop`** - Integration branch for testing combined features

### Feature Branches
- **`feature/interactive-code-editor`** - Monaco-based Solidity editor with syntax highlighting and compilation
- **`feature/ai-assistant`** - Gemini AI integration and code analysis features  
- **`feature/authentication`** - NextAuth.js user authentication and session management
- **`feature/progress-tracking`** - User progress, XP system, and learning analytics
- **`feature/ui-components`** - Glassmorphism/neumorphism UI components and animations
- **`feature/blockchain-integration`** - Web3 wallet connection and testnet deployment

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### 1. Feature Development Process
```bash
# Switch to feature branch
git checkout feature/[feature-name]

# Work on feature with focused commits
git add .
git commit -m "Add: [specific functionality]"
git commit -m "Edit: [specific changes]" 
git commit -m "Del: [removed functionality]"

# Ensure TypeScript builds successfully
npm run build
npm run type-check

# Test feature independently
npm run test
```

### 2. Integration Process
```bash
# Merge completed feature to develop
git checkout develop
git merge feature/[feature-name]

# Test integration
npm run build
npm run test

# Only merge to main when integration is stable
git checkout main
git merge develop
```

## 🛠️ Error Handling Strategy

### TypeScript Error Fixing Phases
1. **Phase 1: Critical Errors**
   - `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` violations
   - Undefined/null safety issues
   - Type declaration problems

2. **Phase 2: Code Quality**
   - Unused variables (remove or prefix with `_`)
   - Unused imports
   - Index signature access (use bracket notation)

3. **Phase 3: Integration Issues**
   - Cross-feature dependencies
   - Export/import conflicts
   - API type mismatches

### Best Practices
- Fix TypeScript errors systematically within each feature branch
- Document cross-feature dependencies in this file
- Use established "Add/Edit/Del" commit prefix pattern
- Test each feature independently before integration
- Use pre-commit hooks and maintenance scripts on all branches

## 📋 Cross-Feature Dependencies

### Identified Dependencies
- **Authentication** ↔ **Progress Tracking**: User session required for XP/progress
- **AI Assistant** ↔ **Code Editor**: Code analysis requires editor content
- **UI Components** → **All Features**: Shared design system components
- **Blockchain Integration** ↔ **Code Editor**: Deployment requires compiled code

### Integration Order (Recommended)
1. **UI Components** - Foundation for all other features
2. **Authentication** - Required for user-specific features
3. **Interactive Code Editor** - Core functionality
4. **AI Assistant** - Enhances code editor
5. **Progress Tracking** - Requires user auth and code interaction
6. **Blockchain Integration** - Final integration requiring all components

## 🔧 Tools and Scripts

### Available Commands
```bash
# Repository maintenance
./scripts/repo-maintenance.sh

# Build and cleanup
npm run clean          # Remove build artifacts
npm run clean:build    # Remove only build outputs  
npm run clean:all      # Remove everything including node_modules

# Development
npm run dev            # Start development server
npm run build          # Production build
npm run type-check     # TypeScript validation
```

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Prevents files >50MB from being committed
- Blocks .next and node_modules commits
- Provides helpful error messages and tips

## 📊 Progress Tracking

### Current Status
- ✅ Branch structure created
- ✅ Documentation established
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks installed
- ✅ Maintenance scripts ready

### Next Steps
1. Choose starting feature branch
2. Implement feature systematically
3. Fix TypeScript errors within branch
4. Test feature independently
5. Document any cross-dependencies discovered
6. Merge to develop for integration testing

## 🚀 Getting Started

To begin development:
1. Choose a feature branch based on dependencies
2. Switch to the branch: `git checkout feature/[name]`
3. Follow the development workflow above
4. Update this document with any new dependencies discovered
