## 🔧 For Your Second User/PC

### **Setup Instructions**
1. **Copy monitoring files** to the second PC
2. **Run the monitoring service** there too
3. **Configure different port** (e.g., 3003) to avoid conflicts
4. **Use the multi-PC config** (`multi-pc-monitoring-config.json`)

### **Example Second PC Setup**
```bash
# On second PC/user
git clone <your-project>
cd learning_solidity

# Use different port to avoid conflict
MONITORING_PORT=3003 ./monitoring-manager.sh start
```

### **Result: Two Separate Dashboards**
- **PC 1 (elo)**: http://localhost:3002 - Shows elo@elo-Z10PE-D16-Series
- **PC 2 (user2)**: http://localhost:3003 - Shows user2@hostname

## 📋 Alert Examples

### **Before (No PC Separation)**
```
🚨 ALERT: main_app - error - fetch failed
🚨 ALERT: database - error - fetch failed
```

### **After (With PC Separation)**
```
🚨 ALERT [elo@elo-Z10PE-D16-Series]: main_app - error - fetch failed
🚨 ALERT [user2@second-pc]: database - error - fetch failed
```
