## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

### Next.js Configuration Updates
The `next.config.js` has been enhanced with:
- Image optimization with modern formats
- Advanced webpack chunking strategy
- Security headers for better protection
- CSS optimization and minification
- Console removal in production

### Component Performance Patterns
```typescript
// Memoization wrapper
export const withMemo = <P extends object>(
  Component: React.ComponentType<P>,
  propsAreEqual?: (prevProps: P, nextProps: P) => boolean
) => memo(Component, propsAreEqual);

// Dynamic imports with loading states
export const LazyCodeEditor = dynamic(
  () => import('@/components/editor/EnhancedCodeEditor'),
  { loading: () => <LoadingState />, ssr: false }
);
```

### Caching Strategy
- **Static Assets**: 30 days with immutable headers
- **API Responses**: 5 minutes to 1 hour based on data type
- **Service Worker**: Offline-first with network fallback

## üìà Performance Monitoring

### Real-time Metrics
The `PerformanceMonitor` component tracks:
- First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- First Input Delay (FID)
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)
- Time to First Byte (TTFB)

### Bundle Analysis
Run `npm run build:analyze` to:
- Visualize bundle composition
- Identify large dependencies
- Find optimization opportunities

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Enable CDN Integration**
   - Configure Cloudflare or Vercel Edge Network
   - Implement edge caching for static assets

2. **Advanced Optimizations**
   - Enable HTTP/3 support
   - Implement Brotli compression
   - Configure resource hints (preconnect, prefetch)

3. **Monitoring & Analytics**
   - Set up Web Vitals tracking
   - Configure performance budgets
   - Implement A/B testing for optimizations

4. **Database Performance**
   - Add database connection pooling
   - Implement read replicas for scaling
   - Configure query caching at database level

5. **Progressive Web App**
   - Complete PWA manifest configuration
   - Enhance offline functionality
   - Add background sync capabilities
